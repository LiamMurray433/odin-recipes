    <h3>
        Ingredients
        <ul>
            dough
            <li>500g strong bread flour</li>
            <li>8g instant yeast</li>
            <li>350g of lukewarm water</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Sauce
            <li>
                1 can of chopped tomatoes
            </li>
            <li>
                1 garlic clove
            </li>   
            <li>
                Generous pinch of basil and oregano
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol> Method
            <li>Mix flour and salt in a large bowl</li>
            <li>Mix yeast with your lukewarm water and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>
                After 5 minutes have passed slowly mix the water in with the flour
                and salt. Finally add the sugar and olive oil. Mix until everything is incoporated.
                You will have a shaggy dough, this is when you turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now hand knead the dough until smooth and some strength has been developed. This may take only a few minutes or over 10.
                The time it takes to develop the dough varies from person to person, flour type and ambient temps. Keep going until you pass the window pane test.
                Once the window pane test has been past place the dough ball in a lighly oiled bowl and leave to ferment for 2-4 hours or until 2-3 times the sized. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Now to divide your dough into 400g portions then tightly shape your dough into a ball. Place on a oiled tray and cover to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
                Preheat your oven to 250 degrees celsius during the proving time. This step is very important. 
                If you don't have a baking stone you could place a pizza tray or baking sheet in the oven during the pre-heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now your dough should be ready to go through the final steps to becoming a delicious pizza.
                Take your proven dough and place on a lightly floured surface and hand stretch to a size of 10 or 12 inches. Once stretched, place your desired toppings and place in the pre-heated oven
                for 12 minutes. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            Sauce Method
            <li>
                Place one can of chopped tomatoes in a bowl with the clove of garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper and herbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a stick blender, blitz the sauce until smooth. Taste the sauce and fix to taste.
